INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SARAH sits at a corner table, nervously checking her phone. The coffee shop is bustling with the morning crowd.

JOHN enters, spotting Sarah and walking over with a warm smile.

JOHN
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was terrible.

SARAH
No problem. I just got here myself.

They sit together, an awkward pause hanging between them.

EXT. PARK - DAY

SARAH and JOHN walk along a tree-lined path, their conversation flowing more naturally now.

JOHN
I've been thinking about what you said yesterday.

SARAH
And?

JOHN
You're right. We should take that trip we've been planning.

SARAH smiles, a look of relief washing over her face.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

SARAH packs a suitcase, excitement evident in her movements. She picks up a photo of her and JOHN, placing it carefully in the bag.

The camera pulls back, showing a plane ticket on the dresser - destination: Paris.

FADE OUT.
